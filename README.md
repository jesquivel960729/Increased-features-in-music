# Increased-features-in-music

This project will analyze the increase in features in music, for this the data of the billboard lists will be analyzed to date, then we'll compare that information with more recent lists like spotify. In addition, machine learning techniques will be used to try to predict the probability that two artists will make a featuring together, given the results obtained in the lists. This project corresponds to the optional data journalism course taught by Professor Yudivian Almeida.
